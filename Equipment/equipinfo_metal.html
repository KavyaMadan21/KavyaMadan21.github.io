      InNOVAtion Labs metalwork area offers a sanctuary for individuals working on metal projects. It grants access to specialized tools that are typically too costly for personal use, as well as a collaborative setting suitable for both novices and seasoned metalworkers.

      Our array of tools includes:
      
      Cutting: Precision cutting tools such as mills, lathes, and bandsaws.
      
      Joining: Welders (MIG and TIG) are commonly used for merging pieces together. Oxyacetylene torches offer an alternative for metal cutting and heating.
      
      Shaping: Grinders for smoothing and polishing cuts, drill presses for creating holes, and benders for forming curves.
      
      Other tools: Additional tools like shears, cold saws, and forges may be available based on reservations.
      
      Knowledge Sharing: We mandate safety certifications for specific equipment usage. This often involves free training sessions covered by membership fees that establish a secure and efficient metalworking foundation. Experienced members are usually present to provide assistance or guidance on your project.
      
      Projects: The opportunities within a metalwork space are extensive. You can craft anything from sculptures and furniture to car parts and robots.
